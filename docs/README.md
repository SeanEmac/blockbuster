## A bitcoin fraud detection dashboard

This is my final year project as part of NUIG Computer Science 2019/2020.

The aim is to develop a visual interface for exploring Bitcoin transactions and their relationships, that will aid fraud analysts in detecting misuse.

Stretch goals will be to incorporate Machine learning into the project.
